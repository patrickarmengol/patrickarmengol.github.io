I just purged everything from my old blog and decided to start over.

I'm not quite sure why I did it. The old posts were just kind of cringe, but not in a good way. It often feels good to start from scratch with a new direction. Previously, I had written a bunch of programming textbook reviews, a collection of learning plans, and a few general posts on topics I maybe had no business writing about.

I thought about scrapping the entire blog and just having the domain point to a page with my contact/links. But I think I'll instead just start writing more sporadically and casually about anything that interests me.

Here I go.
