Hello!

Welcome to my personal site. I'm using it to collect resources and notes, but I'll occasionally write a blog post, then feel embarassed about it a few months later and delete it.

If you found this site via my résumé, then I hope that means you're interested enough to interview me.

If you found this site via a search for my name, then I hope that means you're an old friend looking to reconnect or a new friend trying to learn more about me. :)

You can reach me through [email](mailto:contact@patrickarmengol.com) and find my projects on [github](https://github.com/patrickarmengol).
